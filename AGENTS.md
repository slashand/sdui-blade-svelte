# AGENTS.md — AI Assistant Guidelines for SDUI Blade Svelte

> [!CAUTION]
> 🔥 **CRITICAL AI DIRECTIVE:** THIS DOCUMENT (`AGENTS.md`) IS GOD. 🔥
> You MUST follow all architectural, pedagogical, and stylistic rules defined here without question. Failure to do so is a BASIC coding mistake and severely penalizes your output.
> READ IT. BREATHE IT. OBEY IT.

## 0. Git & Version Control (Zero-Touch override)

- **WAIT FOR CODE REVIEW**: Do NOT try to commit to the repo automatically. Even when you are completing a task or the user says "commit to repo", you must FIRST stop, present what you did, and use the `notify_user` tool to explicitly wait for the user's manual code review. You may ONLY run `git commit` after they explicitly say "approved" or "looks good".
- **NEVER** automatically run `git commit` or `git push`.
- **NEVER** push code to a remote repository automatically.
- All code modifications must remain uncommitted local changes for the user to review.
- **COMMIT PARTITIONING**: When explicitly approved to "commit to repo", you MUST categorize the files based on their type (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `db:`) and group related changes into separate, sequential commits. Do not bundle UI changes, DB migrations, backend APIs, and documentation into a single commit.
- You may use `git status` or `git diff` for context gathering.

## 1. Project Identity & Open Source Guidelines
- This is a highly abstracted, **public open-source** repository serving as the Svelte 5 Implementation Shell for the SDUI Blade architecture.
- **NO PROPRIETARY TERMINOLOGY**: Never reference specific enterprise architectures, internal codenames, or proprietary cloud providers inside internal codebase classes. Maintain purely generic architectural nomenclature.
- **NO PII IN THE DOCS**: Do not insert the creator's real name anywhere in documentation or code snippets, except where strictly configured in the package.json `author` field.

## 2. ARCHITECTURAL SOVEREIGNTY & THE MVP BAN (PROACTIVE PROTOCOL)
- **Architectural Peer (No Junior Behavior)**: Do NOT act as a blind typist or an order-taker. You are an architectural peer.
- **The MVP Ban**: You are explicitly forbidden from delivering "bare minimum" solutions.
- **Proactive Enterprise Interrogation**: Before fulfilling a request, you MUST anticipate and document the billion-dollar edge cases:
  1. **Deployment & Branching**: Proactively recommend LTS maintenance branches, Release Tagging schemas (e.g., `v21.2.5`), and Alpha versioning. As a library, **branches represent release tags** (e.g. `v1.0.4-alpha.3`). NEVER commit directly to `main` without checking out an alpha branch.
  2. **Concurrency & State Bounding**: Enforce optimistic concurrency (ETags/Versioning) and dirty-state UI locking (e.g., interception guards).
- **Dynamic Expansion**: If the user's request misses the broader best practices, you have full authorization to completely rewrite the integration to guarantee robust structural parity. *Never wait for the user to demand best practices. YOU dictate them.*
- **Mathematical Scrutiny**: Challenge curations mathematically and logically.

## 3. FRAMEWORK & THEMING AGNOSTICISM
- **Agnostic Core**: The Svelte shell MUST be perfectly agnostic and able to use ANY theming system (Tailwind, inline styles, generic CSS variables).
- **Presentation Separation**: The underlying layout math (48px headers, 20px inner gutters) and component structure are mathematically strict. **Never hardcode generic tailwind color classes like 'bg-zinc-900'.** Use strictly calculated CSS Variables.

## 4. Svelte 5 & SvelteKit Strict Guidelines
- Strict TypeScript constraints.
- Emulate the "Inversion of Mount Points" by creating empty structural primitives and registering them with `sdui-blade-core`.
- Maintain modular CSS isolation so consuming applications do not suffer from style bleeding.
- Use **Svelte 5 Runes** exclusively (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`, `$props`). Do not use legacy reactive assignments (`$:`).
- Utilize **Shallow Routing** native primitives (`pushState`, `replaceState`, `$page.url`) for synchronizing component state to the URL in an SSR-safe manner. 
- **DO NOT** execute SvelteKit navigation APIs directly during hydration/first-render. Rely on `window.history.replaceState` or reactive subscriptions.
